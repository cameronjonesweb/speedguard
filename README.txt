== Idea Behind ==
Doing SEO for clients and my own projects for the past 10 years, I noticed the solution to the not-getting-traffic problem often can be found in quite basic things: sitemap, robots.txt, duplicates, redirections. But, first of all, page speed. 
 
Today, if your website loads slow, there is no need to even bother with any other optimization at all. 

Page load time is one of Google’s top priorities for 2020 and it’s also its ranking signal. <strong>If Google’s crawler can't access your website because it's loading slow or throwing errors, it will never proceed further with indexation and ranking</strong>, and as a result, your website won't get any decent organic traffic.

I wanted an easy-to-use tool to warn me in case my website load time may harm it’s search rankings. I wanted a native WordPress solution, with all information available from the dashboard, simple but still informative, a guard who will do the monitoring every day and ping me, in case something goes wrong. I have not found one and that's why I've built SpeedGuard plugin. 

I'll be happy to know that you find it useful as well!

3. Settings: widgets, tests and notifications
== Installation ==
= Automatic plugin installation: =
1. Go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress Admin
2. Search for SpeedGuard plugin
3. Click Install SpeedGuard
4. Activate SpeedGuard after installation
5. Follow further instructions to get API key and start using SpeedGuard
= Getting API Key for free testing: =
1. Fill out this [short form](http://www.webpagetest.org/getkey.php)
2. Check your email and confirm the request
3. You will receive the email with "WebPagetest API Key" subject. Copy your API key from this email into the field on SpeedGuard->Settings page and press "Save API Key".

= Configuration: =
Go to the SpeedGuard->Settings page to set the scan frequency and whether you prefer to be emailed. 

For example, you can set tests to run every day and send you a performance report every day, too. 

Or you may want to receive an email just in case the average site speed is worse than say, 5 seconds (adjustable too). 
In this case, the plugin will perform tests every day but only send you the warning if your site is loading slower than the time you have set.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What service is used for performing tests? =
SpeedGuard is using [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) API, to get reliable test results.

= How accurate the results are? =
Each test is run 3 times (cache disabled), then the average is calculated and displayed in order to get accurate results.
 
= Where the site speed is tested from? =
Currently, SpeedGuard runs all tests from the server in Dulles, VA, USA. Soon I'll add the ability to choose the custom location.

= Are the speed results for desktop or mobile users? =
Currently, SpeedGuard runs all tests for the desktop users using a cable Internet connection. Soon I'll add the ability to monitor load time for mobile devices as well.

= How many tests I can perform per day? =
You can run up to 65 tests per day. It can be 65 different URLs from your website tested once per day or 65 tests of one specific page — it’s up to you. There is a widget on SpeedGuard pages that shows how many tests you have already used.
